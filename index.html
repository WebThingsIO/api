      <p>This document describes a common data model and API for the Web of Things. The <a href="#web-thing-description">Web Thing Description</a> provides a vocabulary for describing physical devices connected to the World Wide Web in a machine readable format with a default JSON encoding. Common device capabilities can be specified using optional <a href="#context-member">semantic annotations</a>. The <a href="#web-thing-rest-api">Web Thing REST API</a> and <a href="#web-thing-websocket-api">Web Thing WebSocket API</a> allow a web client to access the properties of devices, request the execution of actions and subscribe to events representing a change in state..</p>

      <p>This document includes a proposed plain JSON serialisation of a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-thing-description/">Thing Description</a> and a concrete HTTP and WebSockets <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-binding-templates/">protocol binding</a> for the Web of Things. This proposal is intended to complement the current <a href="https://www.w3.org/WoT/WG/">W3C Web of Things Working Group</a>'s work on an abstract data model and API for the Web of Things, by defining a simple concrete serialisation and protocol binding using existing web technologies which can be used today, and don't require web clients to implement a new <a href="https://w3c.github.io/wot-scripting-api/">Scripting API</a>, multiple non-web IoT protocols, or an RDF-based parser.</p>
      <p>While the standardisation process continues, this document will continue to be maintained to reflect the current API implemented by Mozilla's own open source Web of Things implementation through <a href="https://iot.mozilla.org/">Project Things</a>. We encourage developers to continue to implement this API to build web things compatible with Mozilla's <a href="https://iot.mozilla.org/gateway/">Things Gateway</a>, and provide feedback to help us further improve the specification.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The goal of the Web of Things is to extend the web of pages into a web of things by giving connected devices URLs on the World Wide Web. This will allow the web to be used as a unifying application layer for a decentralized Internet of Things.</p>
      <p>Whilst web technologies are already in widespread use on the Internet of Things, this is currently done with mostly proprietary data formats and APIs which require per-vendor integrations to make devices interoperable. In order to promote ad-hoc interoperability on the Internet of Things a shared vocabulary and common API is needed.</p>
      <p>In this document we propose a common data model and API for the Web of Things.</p>

        <h3><code>@context</code> member</h3>
        <p>The <code>@context</code> member is an optional annotation which can be used to provide a URI for a schema repository which defines standard schemas for common "types" of device capabilities. These types can then be referred to using <code>@type</code> annotations elsewhere in the Thing Description.</p>
        <div class="note">Example experimental schema repositories can be found at <a href="http://iotschema.org/">http://iotschema.org/</a> and <a href="https://iot.mozilla.org/schemas">https://iot.mozilla.org/schemas</a>.</div>
        <pre class="example" title="Example @context member">"@context": "https://iot.mozilla.org/schemas"</pre>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>@type</code> member</h3>
        <p>The <code>@type</code> member is an optional annotation which can be used to provide the names of schemas for types of capabilities a device supports, from a schema repository referred to in the <code>@context</code> member. The value of the <code>@type</code> member is a string or an array of strings which correspond to schema names from a schema repository.</p>
        <p>Providing a <code>@type</code> annotation tells a client that it can expect the device to conform to the constraints of that type's schema. This may include certain types of property, action and event the device can be expected to support. A client may make use of this information to aid in automation of or to generate a user interface for known standard device capabilities.
        </p>
        <pre class="example" title="Example @type member">"@type": ["Light", "OnOffSwitch"]</pre>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>name</code> member</h3>
        <p>The name member is a human friendly string which describes the device. This can be set to any value by the device creator and may include a brand name or model number.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>description</code> member</h3>
        <p>The description member is a human friendly string which describes the device and its functions. This can be set to any value by the device creator.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>properties</code> member</h3>
        <p>The properties member is a map of <a href="#property-object">Property objects</a> which describe the attributes of the device.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>actions</code> member</h3>
        <p>The actions member is a map of <a href="#action-object">Action objects</a> which describe functions that can be carried out on a device. Actions are used when the setting of a property alone is not sufficient to affect a required change in state. This may be used to describe a function which takes a period of time to complete, manipulates multiple properties, or has a different outcome based on provided arguments or current state. An example might include a "fade" action which has a specified "duration", a "sequence" action which triggers a sequence of flashing lights or a "toggle" action on a switch.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>events</code> member</h3>
        <p>The events member is a map of <a href="#event-object">Event objects</a> which define the types of events which may be emitted by a device. Events can be used where subscribing to a change in property state is not sufficient. This may be used to monitor changes in multiple properties or events which describe something other than a property change. An example might be an event which is emitted when a device is about to reboot.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>links</code> member</h3>
        <p>The links member provides an array of link relations ([[!web-linking]]) to other resources of a thing. Links can include a link relation type (<code>rel</code>) and an optional media type (<code>mediaType</code>). Examples of links include a link to a <a href="#properties-resource">Properties resource</a> (<code>"rel":"properties"</code>), an <a href="#actions-resource">Actions resource</a> (<code>"rel":"actions"</code>) or an <a href="#events-resource">Events resource</a>. It can also include links to alternate representations of a thing such as a WebSocket API endpoint or an HTML user interface (<code>"rel":"alternate"</code>).</p>
        <pre class="example" title="Example links member">"links": [

        <h3><code>Property</code> object</h3>
        <p>A property object describes an attribute of a Thing and is indexed by a property id. A property description may include its primitive <code>type</code> (one of null, boolean, object, array, number, integer or string as per [[!json-schema]]), semantic <code>@type</code> (as per the Thing Description's <a href="#context-member"><code>@context</code></a>), <code>unit</code> ([[!SI]] unit), <code>label</code> (human friendly name), <code>description</code> (human friendly description), <code>href</code> (URL of a <a href="#property-resource">Property resource</a>), <code>enum</code> (list of enumerated options for the value), <code>readOnly</code> (indicating whether or not the property is read-only), and a <code>minimum</code> and <code>maximum</code> value.</p>
        <pre class="example" title="Property Object">
"level" : {
  "label": "Level",
  "description": "The level of light from 0-100",
  "@type": "LevelProperty",

  "unit": "percent",
  "minimum": 0,
  "maximum": 100,
  "readOnly": false,
  "href": "/things/lamp/properties/level"
}
        </pre>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>Action</code> object</h3>
        <p>An action object describes a function which can be carried out on a device. An action definition may include a <code>label</code> (human friendly name), <code>description</code> (human friendly description) and a <code>href</code> (URL of an <a href="#action-resource">Action resource</a>).</p>
        <p>An action may also specify an <code>input</code> object with a primitive <code>type</code> (one of null, boolean, object, array, number, integer or string as per [[!json-schema]]), semantic <code>@type</code> (as per the Thing Description's <a href="#context-member"><code>@context</code></a>), <code>unit</code> ([[!SI]] unit) and a <code>minimum</code> and <code>maximum</code> value.
        <pre class="example" title="Action Object">

}
      </pre>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3><code>Event</code> object</h3>
      <p>An event object describes a kind of event which may be emitted by a device. This may include a primitive <code>type</code> (one of null, boolean, object, array, number, integer or string as per [[!json-schema]]), semantic <code>@type</code> (as per the Thing Description's <a href="#context-member"><code>@context</code></a>), <code>unit</code> ([[!SI]] unit), <code>label</code> (human friendly name), <code>description</code> (human friendly description), <code>href</code> (URL of an <a href="#event-resource">Event resource</a>) and a <code>minimum</code> and <code>maximum</code> value.
      <pre class="example" title="Event Object">
"overheated": {
  "label": "Overheated",
  "description": "The lamp has exceeded its safe operating temperature",
  "@type": "OverheatedEvent",

      <h3>Media Type</h3>
      <p>The JSON serialization of the Web Thing Description is identified by the Media Type <code>application/td+json</code>.</p>
      <div class="note">This media type has not yet been registered with IANA.</div>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Alternative Encodings</h3>
      <p>The default encoding for the Thing description is JSON, but other encodings such as XML, JSON-LD or CBOR may be used. Alternative encodings are beyond the scope of this specification but may be defined separately.</p>
      <p>References to alternative available encodings may be provided using Link HTTP response headers with the alternate link relation. A client can express a preference for an alternative encoding using HTTP content negotiation.</p>
    </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Web Thing REST API</h2>
        <p>The Web Thing API provides a web services based programming interface with a RESTful design for applications to access the properties of devices, request the execution of actions and access a list of events representing a change in state. A default HTTP [[!HTTP11]] protocol binding is defined here.</p>
        <p>The Web Thing REST API consists of a number of different types of resources which represent different aspects of a device and can be independently referenced by a URL. The specific URLs and URL structure of resources are defined by the Thing Description. This specification does <strong>not</strong> define a fixed URL structure.</p>
      <section>
        <h3><code>Thing</code> resource</h3>
        <p>A thing Resource provides a <a href="#web-thing-description">Thing Description</a> for a device. A Thing Resource is considered the root resource of a Thing.</p>
        <p>The URL of a Thing Resource may be enumerated by the <code>href</code> member of Thing object in a <a href="#things-resource">Things Resource</a> provided by a gateway or directory, or may be discovered by some other means.</p>
        <p>A Thing description is usually read only. An HTTP GET request can be used to retrieve a Thing Description for a Thing.</p>
        <p><strong>Example: Get a description of a Thing</strong></p>

      <h3>Alternative Protocol Bindings</h3>
      <p>The default protocol binding for the Web Thing REST API is HTTP(S). Bindings to alternative application protocols (e.g. CoAP) may be used, but these bindings are beyond the scope of this specification. A Web Thing API protocol binding may also be layered on top of a non-Internet application protocol by use of a gateway.</p>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Web Thing WebSocket API</h2>
      <p>The Web Thing WebSocket API complements the REST API to provide a realtime mechanism to make multiple requests and be notified of events as soon as they happen, by keeping a WebSocket [[!WEBSOCKETS-PROTOCOL]] open on the Web Thing. The "webthing" WebSocket subprotocol defined here has a simple set of message types and a JSON response format consistent with the Web Thing REST API.</p>
    <section>
      <h3>Protocol Handshake</h3>
      <p>To open a WebSocket on a Thing, an HTTP GET request is upgraded to a WebSocket using a standard WebSocket protocol handshake [[!WEBSOCKETS-PROTOCOL]] and the "webthing" subprotocol. The WebSocket URL for a Web Thing is specified in the links member of the Web Thing Description.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <div class="example-title marker">

      <p>A WebSocket can be opened from a web page using the JavaScript <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/">WebSocket API</a> which will take care of the handshake detailed above and allow messages to be sent and received.</p>

      <h3><code>setProperty</code> message</h3>
      <p>The <code>setProperty</code> message type is sent from a web client to a Web Thing in order to set the value of one or more of its properties. This is equivalent to a <code>PUT</code> request on a Property resource URL using the REST API, but with the WebSocket API a property value can be changed multiple times in quick succession over an open socket and multiple properties can be set at the same time.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <div class="example-title marker">

      <h3><code>requestAction</code> message</h3>
      <p>The <code>requestAction</code> message type is sent from a web client to a Web Thing to request an action be carried out on a Web Thing. This is equivalent to a <code>POST</code> request on an Actions resource URL using the REST API, but multiple actions can be requested at the same time or in quick succession over an open socket.</p>

      <h3><code>addEventSubscription</code> message</h3>
      <p>The <code>addEventSubscription</code> message type is sent from a web client to a Web Thing to allow a client to subscribe to a particular event type, defined by the <code>events</code> member of a Web Thing description. This is similar to adding an event listener in JavaScript, but events are received as an <code>event</code> message over the Web Thing WebSocket API.</p>

      <h3><code>propertyStatus</code> message</h3>
      <p>The <code>propertyStatus</code> message type is sent from a Web Thing to a web client whenever a property of a Web Thing changes. The payload data of this message is in the same format as a response to a <code>GET</code> request on Property resource using the REST API, but the message is pushed to the client whenever a property changes and can include multiple properties at the same time.

      <h3><code>actionStatus</code> message</h3>
      <p>The <code>actionStatus</code> message type is sent from a Web Thing to a web client when the status of a requested action changes.
