      <p>This document describes a common data model and API for the Web of Things. The <a href="#web-thing-description">Web Thing Description</a> provides a vocabulary for describing physical devices connected to the World Wide Web in a machine readable format with a default JSON encoding. The <a href="#web-thing-rest-api">Web Thing REST API</a> and <a href="#web-thing-websocket-api">Web Thing WebSocket API</a> allow a web client to access the properties of devices, request the execution of actions and subscribe to events representing a change in state. Some basic <a href="#web-thing-types">Web Thing Types</a> are provided and additional types can be defined using semantic extensions with JSON-LD.</p>
      <p>In addition to this specification there is a note on <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oyTM3NPjQOOohTqkjfq1klHalfcEn5w9Ull0_wadbJw/edit?usp=sharing">Web Thing API Protocol Bindings</a> which proposes non-normative bindings of the Web Thing API to various existing IoT protocols. There is also a document describing <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H3coHbb3Bwd02_NJi4KEBONByUkq92_HsTk1IpfmACY/edit?usp=sharing">Web of Things Integration Patterns</a> which provides advice on different design patterns for integrating connected devices with the Web of Things, and where each pattern is most appropriate.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The goal of the Web of Things is to extend the web of pages into a web of things by giving connected devices URLs on the World Wide Web. This will allow the web to be used as a unifying application layer for a decentralized Internet of Things.</p>
      <p>Whilst web technologies are already in widespread use on the Internet of Things, this is currently done with mostly proprietary data formats and APIs which require per-vendor integrations to make devices interoperable. In order to promote ad-hoc interoperability on the Internet of Things a shared vocabulary and common API is needed.</p>
      <p>In this document we propose a common data model and API for the Web of Things.</p>

      </div>

      <section>
        <h3><code>name</code> member</h3>
        <p>The name member is a user friendly string which describes the device. This can be set to any value by the device creator and may include a brand name or model number.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>type</code> member</h3>
        <p>The type member defines the type of device described by the Thing Description. See "Device Types" for possible values.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>description</code> member</h3>
        <p>The description member is a user friendly string which describes the device and its functions. This can be set to any value by the device creator.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>properties</code> member</h3>
        <p>The properties member is a map of property objects which describe the attributes of the device.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>actions</code> member</h3>
        <p>The actions member is a map of action objects which describe functions that can be carried out on a device. Actions are used when the setting of properties is not sufficient to affect a required change in state. This may be used to describe a function which manipulates multiple properties or accepts arguments and has a different effect depending on which arguments are provided. An example might include a "reboot" action which power cycles a device.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>events</code> member</h3>
        <p>The events member is a map of event objects which define the types of events which may be emitted by a device. Events can be used where subscribing to a change in property state is not sufficient. This may be used to monitor changes in multiple properties or events which describe something other than a property change. An example might be an event which is emitted when a device is about to reboot.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>links</code> member</h3>
        <p>The links member provides a map of URLs for Properties, Actions and Events resources. It can also contain a WebSocket URL to be used for the Thing's WebSocket API. Entries in this map have a key which can be one of "properties", "actions", "events" or "websocket" and a string value representing a URL.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>Property</code> object</h3>
        <p>A property object describes an attribute of a Thing and is indexed by a property name. A property description may include its type, unit, description and URL.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>Action</code> object</h3>
        <p>An action object describes a function which can be carried out on a device. An action description may include action parameters and a human friendly description which describes what the action does.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3><code>Event</code> object</h3>
        <p>An event object describes a type of event which may be emitted by a device. This may include the type of values which may be included in the event and a human friendly description which describes what the event means.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Alternative Encodings</h3>
        <p>The default encoding for the Thing description is JSON, but other encodings such as XML, JSON-LD or CBOR may be used. Alternative encodings are beyond the scope of this specification but may be defined separately.</p>
        <p>References to alternative available encodings may be provided using Link HTTP response headers with the alternate link relation. A client can express a preference for an alternative encoding using HTTP content negotiation.</p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Web Thing REST API</h2>
        <p>The Web Thing API provides a web services based programming interface with a RESTful design for applications to access the properties of devices, request the execution of actions and access a list of events representing a change in state. A default HTTP protocol binding is defined here.</p>
        <p>The Web Thing REST API consists of a number of different types of resources which represent different aspects of a device and can be independently referenced by a URL. The specific URLs and URL structure of resources are defined by the author of a Thing Description using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">HATEOAS</a> approach. This specification does <strong>not</strong> define a fixed URL structure.</p>
      <section>
        <h3><code>Thing</code> resource</h3>
        <p>A Thing Resource provides a Thing Description of a device including its name, type, description, properties, actions and events. A Thing Resource is considered the root resource of a Thing.</p>
        <p>A Thing description is usually read only. An HTTP GET request can be used to retrieve a Thing Description for a Thing.</p>
        <p><strong>Example: Get a description of a Thing</strong></p>

      <h3><code>Actions</code> resource</h3>
      <p>An actions resource represents a queue of actions to be executed on a device. A new action is created in the queue with an HTTP POST request and can be deleted from the queue with an HTTP DELETE request. The current status of an action request can be retrieved with an HTTP GET request and updated with an HTTP PUT request.</p>
      <p><strong>Example: Request an action</strong></p>

      <h3>Alternative Protocol Bindings</h3>
      <p>The default protocol binding for the Web Thing REST API is HTTP(S). Bindings to alternative application protocols (e.g. CoAP) may be used, but these bindings are beyond the scope of this specification. A Web Thing API protocol binding may also be layered on top of a non-Internet application protocol by use of a gateway.</p>
      <p>Guidance for both types of bindings is provided in a separate note called <a href="#">Web Thing API Protocol Bindings</a>.</p>
      <p>References to available alternative protocol bindings may be provided in HTTP responses using an Alt-Svc HTTP response header.</p>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Web Thing WebSocket API</h2>
      <p>The Web Thing WebSocket API complements the REST API to provide a realtime mechanism to make multiple requests and be notified of events as soon as they happen, by keeping a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">WebSocket</a> open on the Web Thing. The "webthing" WebSocket subprotocol defined here has a simple set of message types and a JSON response format consistent with the Web Thing REST API.</p>
    <section>
      <h3>Protocol Handshake</h3>
      <p>To open a WebSocket on a Thing, an HTTP GET request is upgraded to a WebSocket using a standard <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">WebSocket protocol</a> handshake and the "webthing" subprotocol. The WebSocket URL for a Web Thing is specified in the links member of the Web Thing Description.</p>
      <div class="example">

      <h3><code>setProperty</code> message</h3>
      <p>The <code>setProperty</code> message type is sent from a web client to a Web Thing in order to set the value of one or more of its properties. This is equivalent to a <code>PUT</code> request on a Property resource URL using the REST API, but with the WebSocket API a property value can be changed multiple times in quick succession over an open socket and multiple properties can be set at the same time.</p>

      <h3><code>requestAction</code> message</h3>
      <p>The <code>requestAction</code> message type is sent from a web client to a Web Thing to request an action be carried out on a Web Thing. This is equivalent to a <code>POST</code> request on an Actions resource URL using the REST API, but multiple actions can be requested at the same time or in quick succession over an open socket.</p>

      <p>The <code>addEventSubscription</code> message type is sent from a web client to a Web Thing to allow a client to subscribe to a particular event type, defined by the <code>events</code> member of a Web Thing description. This is similar to adding an event listener in JavaScript, but events are received as an <code>event</code> message over the Web Thing WebSocket API.</p>

      <h3><code>propertyStatus</code> message</h3>
      <p>The <code>propertyStatus</code> message type is sent from a Web Thing to a web client whenever a property of a Web Thing changes. The payload data of this message is in the same format as a response to a <code>GET</code> request on Property resource using the REST API, but the message is pushed to the client whenever a property changes and can include multiple properties at the same time.

      <h3><code>actionStatus</code> message</h3>
      <p>The <code>actionStatus</code> message type is sent from a Web Thing to a web client when the status of a requested action changes. The payload data is consistent with the format of an Action resource in the REST API, but messages are pushed to the client as soon as the status of an action changes.
      <div class="example">
        <div class="example-title marker">
          Example
        </div>

      <h3><code>event</code> message</h3>
      <p>The <code>event</code> message type is sent from a Web Thing to a web client when an event occurs on the Web Thing. The payload data is consistent with the format of an Event resource in the REST API but messages are pushed to the client as soon as an event occurs.

    <h2>Web Thing Types</h2>
      <p>This specification defines a set of common device types which can be used in a Thing Description. This list is not intended to be exhaustive, but defines a core set of built in types which can be mapped to device types in existing underlying IoT protocols, using non-normative protocol bindings.</p>

        <h3>Extensibility with JSON-LD</h3>
        <p>The Web Thing Description format uses a schema based system which allows anyone to define their own Web Thing types and share them with others in order to encourage interoperability. <a href="https://json-ld.org/">JSON-LD</a> notation is used to add semantic annotations to a Thing Description in order to establish a shared semantic context and define a Web Thing type.</p>

        <p>The <code>@context</code> property provides an IRI which defines a globally unique "context" within which types are defined. The optional <code>@type</code> property specifies a Web Thing type from that context to be applied to the thing being described.</p>
        <div class="note">When no <code>@context</code> property is supplied, a default Web Thing context is assumed (to be defined) and <code>type</code> is equivalent to <code>@type</code>.</div>
